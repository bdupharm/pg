pg
==

A light wrapper around psql, making it easier to define default arguments for
connecting to various hosts.

Usage of this command requires a ~/.pgalias file, which is actually just a
shell script defining variables to be used as alias arguments. For instance,
you might have a ~/.pgalias file like so:

fetch="-vFETCH_COUNT=10000"
local="$fetch -p 5433"
remote="$fetch -d ryan -U ryan"

test="$local -d test"
staging="$remote -h staging.ryankelly.us"
prod="$remote -h ryankelly.us"

You would then be able to connect to, say, staging.ryankelly.us with your
chosen options as follows:

pg staging

And that's it. You can pipe and do whatever else, and your ~/.pgpass and
~/.psqlrc files are used like normal.
